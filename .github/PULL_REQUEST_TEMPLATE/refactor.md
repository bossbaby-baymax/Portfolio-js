- [ ] Updated unit tests to cover the changes (if applicable).

### 📸 Screenshots, videos, or GIFs (Optional)

_If the refactor has a visible impact on the user interface (UI), add screenshots, videos, or GIFs here that show the visual improvements or changes (if any). This is especially useful for refactored front-end components. If not applicable, you can delete this section._

### 🛠️ Technical considerations and notes

**Impact on the project:**
